Please fix the Holdings Manager tab by updating index.html and Code.gs to ensure action buttons are always available and the search functions correctly. In index.html, modify the searchHoldings function to prevent a crash when clicking AWBs by wrapping x.id and x.netNo in String() before calling .toLowerCase(), and crucially, update the if(isNA) conditional block to ensure that the Clear Hold and Mark RTO buttons are always included in the actionBtn HTML for any shipment where isOnHold is true, even if the destination or network is 'NA'. In the backend Code.gs, update getAllData to merge on-hold shipments from the Advance_Records sheet into the main holdings array, use the entry date as a fallback for the 'Date Held' display if the timestamp is missing, and ensure handleManageHold is robust enough to update the holdStatus in whichever sheet the record resides. Finally, ensure all shipments marked as 'RTO' are strictly filtered out from active holdings and workflow lists to maintain a clean workspace.
